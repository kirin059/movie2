      structured corridor-type building system.

              a long wig but the director thought that it looks better on 준우 character in the movie than wig.</li>
            <li>The background in this movie is an apartment complex in 여의도. It is structured as corridor-type building system
              which is quite unusual these days.     The director was intended to show both sense of freshment from the young and
              familiarity at 30 years of age.</li>
